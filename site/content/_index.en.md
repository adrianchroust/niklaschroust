# About me

I was born on June 4th, 2004 in Vienna as the second of three children.
I started taking piano lessons at the age of six, followed by two years of violin lessons.
Over time, I discovered my passion for composing and four years ago began studying composition with
Mr. Mag. Hans G. Kitzbichler at the Johann Sebastian Bach Music School – and the passion is here to stay.
Currently I attend the second grade of the Bundes Oberstufen Realgymnasium Hegelgasse 12
für Musik & Kunst in Vienna, a high school with focus on music and arts.
